# About The Project

LMS SMAGA is a web-based application designed to support learning in Senior High Schools (SMA) in Indonesia through a Learning Management System (LMS) that is integrated with the needs of the national curriculum. This platform adopts a blended learning approach to improve learning efficiency, facilitate access to materials, and support better interaction between students, teachers, and admins.

By using modern technologies such as Laravel for the backend, ReactJS TypeScript for the frontend, and Tailwind CSS for styling, LMS SMAGA offers an intuitive and responsive user experience. This system also integrates important features, such as token-based authentication, class management, attendance tracking, access to learning materials, and announcement management.

Teachers can manage access to materials, manage attendance, and provide direct notifications to students, while admins have the ability to manage users, classes, and learning modules as a whole. LMS SMAGA aims to make a real contribution to improving the quality of education in Indonesia, enabling students to learn independently, while creating a more organized and efficient learning space.

By focusing on the specific needs of SMA Negeri 3 Purwokerto, LMS SMAGA is expected to become a model of digital learning solutions that can be adapted by other educational institutions in Indonesia.
